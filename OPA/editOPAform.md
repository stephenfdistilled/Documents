## Overview

- User can access OPA edit page by clicking on the â€˜editâ€™ link on the OPA results page

- Force authenticates user, then submits userId in request to get previously completed OPA form
    
    ```tsx
    const token = await authorise(
        {
          ctx,
          redirectBackTo: '/daft-mortgages/online-pre-application',
          forceLogIn: true,
        },
        'daft',
      );
    ```
    
    ```tsx
    const { data = null, status = null } = ctx.query.submit
        ? {}
        : await AccountsAPI.getPreApprovalInputs(
            token,
            ctx.res.locals.user?.user_id ? ctx.res.locals.user?.user_id : 1619756, //1619756 will only be reached by Cypress tests (When a user signs in they will always have a user id, if not signed in they will have been re-directed)
          );
    ```
    
- If a form exists, the inputs are retrieved and populate the form, if none found user is re-directed to create an OPA form
    
    ```tsx
    //if problem with auth or no existing OPA form send to create OPA page
      if (
        status === 401 ||
        (status === 200 && !data) ||
        (status === 404 && ctx.res.locals.user)
      ) {
        res.redirect('/daft-mortgages/online-pre-application');
      }
    
      return { props: { inputs: data, status, token } };
    ```
    
- Format of how user inputs should be do not exactly match what is retrieved from the backend. To get around this an object called Response is created in the correct format.
    
    ```tsx
    //Sample form object in correct format
      const response: any = {
        hasMissedPayments: 'false',
        firstApplicantCitizenship: 'true',
        firstApplicantTaxResident: 'false',
        firstApplicantVisaType: { values: [''] },
        hasAppliedForMortgage: 'false',
        hasAppliedHelpToBuy: 'false',
        hasArrearsHistory: 'false',
        hasDebtIssuesHistory: 'false',
        hasEvidentSavingsRecords: 'false',
        hasEvidentRentRecords: '',
        hasFoundAProperty: 'false',
        hasPotentialRepaymentIssues: 'false',
        isRenting: 'false',
        mortgageAmount: '100000',
        estimatedPurchasePrice: '',
        mortgageApplicationStatus: { values: [''] },
        secondApplicantCitizenship: 'false',
        secondApplicantTaxResident: 'false',
        secondApplicantVisaType: { values: [''] },
      };
    ```
    
- Values from the userâ€™s inputs are then copied into the new Response object
    
    ```tsx
    Object.keys(response).forEach(function (key) {
        //Ensure booleans converted to string as form will not pre-populate boolean data
        if (typeof inputs[key] === 'boolean') {
          inputs[key] = inputs[key].toString();
        }
        //Convert the select values from strings to objects
        if (response[key].values) {
          response[key].values[0] = inputs[key];
        } else {
          response[key] = inputs[key];
        }
      });
    ```
    
- Booleans converted into string as the form will not pre-populate the edit form unless values are strings.
- firstApplicantVisaType, secondApplicantVisaType and mortgageApplicationStatus are returned as single strings from Backend. eg â€˜STAMP_1â€™.
- These need to be converted into {values : â€˜STAMP_1â€™}
- the Response object is then passed to BBForm with the fetched values in the correct format
    
    ```tsx
    <BuyingBudgetForm
            pages={editPreApplicationFormConfig}
            inputs={response}
            formName="preApproval"
            token={token}
          />
    ```
